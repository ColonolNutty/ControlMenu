Drag and drop all folders and files directly into your "The Sims 4/Mods" folder

Delete the existing files from previous versions if they exist!

The final paths for the files should be the following:

The Sims 4/Mods/controlmenu.package
The Sims 4/Mods/controlmenu.ts4script


---- Usage ----

To use the mod, simply click on a Sim or on various objects then navigate to the Control Menu interaction
Please note: If the control menu does not appear when clicking on some things, it likely means functionality is not yet available for that thing.
